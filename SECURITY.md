- Work with us to understand impact

**DON'T:**
- Post vulnerabilities publicly before disclosure
- Exploit vulnerabilities maliciously
- Access other users' data
- Disrupt the service

### How to Report

**Preferred Method:**
1. Email: [Create private issue on GitHub]
2. Subject: "SECURITY: [Brief description]"
3. Include: Steps to reproduce, impact assessment, suggested fixes

**Information to Include:**
- Vulnerability description
- Affected versions
- Reproduction steps
- Proof of concept (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation

### Response Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 24 hours | Acknowledge receipt |
| 72 hours | Initial assessment |
| 7 days | Detailed analysis |
| 30 days | Fix implementation |
| 90 days | Public disclosure (if unresolved) |
